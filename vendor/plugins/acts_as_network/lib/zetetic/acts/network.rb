    # = UnionCollection
    # UnionCollection provides useful application-space functionality
    # for emulating set unions acrosss ActiveRecord collections. 
    #
    # A UnionCollection can be initialized with zero or more sets, 
    # although generally it must contain at least two to do anything 
    # useful. Once initialized, the UnionCollection itself will 
    # act as an array containing all of the records from each of its 
    # member sets. The following will create a union object containing
    # the unique results of each individual find
    #
    #   union = Zetetic::Acts::UnionCollection.new(
    #     Person.find(:all, :conditions => "id <= 1"),                # set 0
    #     Person.find(:all, :conditions => "id >= 10 AND id <= 15"),  # set 1
    #     Person.find(:all, :conditions => "id >= 20")                # set 2
    #   )
    #
    # UnionCollection's more interesting feature is how it will 
    # intelligently forward ActiveRecord method calls to its member 
    # sets. This allows you to execute find operations directly on a 
    # UnionCollection, that will be executed on one or more 
    # of the member sets. Given the prior definition calling
    #
    #   union.find(:all, :conditions => "id <= 1 OR id >= 20")
    #
    # would return an array containing all the records from set 0
    # and set 2 (set 1 would be implicity excluded by the <tt>:conditions</tt>),
    #
    #   union.find_by_name('george')
    #
    # would return a single entry fetched from set 2 if george's id was >= 20,
    # 
    #   union.find(30)
    # 
    # would retrieve the record from set 2 with id == 30, and
    # 
    #   union.find(9)
    # 
    # would throw an #ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception because that id 
    # is specifically excluded from the union's member sets.
    # 
    # UnionCollection operates according to the following rules:
    #
    # * <tt>find :first</tt> - will search the sets in order and return the 
    #   first record that matches the find criteria.
    # * <tt>find :all</tt> - will search the sets, returning a 
    #   UnionCollection containing the all matching results. This UnionCollection
    #   can, of course, be searched further
    # * <tt>find(ids)</tt> - will look through all member sets in search
    #   of records with the given ids. #ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound will 
    #   be raised unless all the IDs are located.
    # * <tt>find_by_*</tt> - works as expected, behaving like <tt>find :first</tt>
    # * <tt>find_all_by_*</tt> - works as expected like <tt>find :all</tt>

      module ClassMethods
        # = acts_as_network
        # ActsAsNetork expects a few things to be present before it is
        # called. Namely, you need to establish the existance of either
        # 1. a HABTM join table; or
        # 2. an intermediate Join model
        # 
        # == HABTM
        #
        # In the first case, +acts_as_network+ will assume that your HABTM table is named
        # in a self-referential manner based on the model name. i.e. if your model is called
        # +Person+ it will assume the HABTM join table is called +people_people+.
        # It will also default the +foreign_key+ column to be named after the model: +person_id+. 
        # The default +association_foreign_key+ column will be the +foreign_key+ name with +_target+
        # appended.
        #
        #   acts_as_network :friends
        #
        # You can override any of these options in your call to +acts_as_network+. The
        # following will use a join table named +friends+ with a foreign key of +person_id+
        # and an association foreign key of +friend_id+
        #
        #   acts_as_network :friends, :join_table => :friends, :foreign_key => 'person_id', :association_foreign_key => 'friend_id'
        #
        # == Join Model
        #
        # In the second case +acts_as_network+ will need to be told which model to use to perform the join - this is 
        # accomplished by passing a symbol for the join model to the <tt>:through</tt> option. So, with a join model called invites
        # use:
        #
        #   acts_as_network :friends, :through => :invites
        #
        # The same assumptions are made relative to the foreign_key and association_foreign_key columns, which can be overriden using
        # the same options. It may be useful to include <tt>:conditions</tt> as well depending on the specific requirements of the 
        # join model. The following will create a network relation using a join model named +Invite+ with a foreign_key of 
        # +person_id+, an association_foreign_key of +friend_id+, where the Invite's +is_accepted+ field
        # is true.
        #
        #   acts_as_network :friends, :through => :invites, :foreign_key => 'person_id', 
        #                   :association_foreign_key => 'friend_id', :conditions => "is_accepted = 't'"
        #
        # The valid configuration options that can be passed to +acts_as_network+ follow:
        #
        # * <tt>:through</tt> - class to use for has_many :through relationship. If omitted acts_as_network 
        #   will fall back on a HABTM relation
        # * <tt>:join_table</tt> - when using a simple HABTM relation, this allows you to override the 
        #   name of the join table. Defaults to <tt>model_model</tt> format, i.e. people_people
        # * <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - name of the foreign key for the origin side of relation - 
        #   i.e. person_id.
        # * <tt>:association_foreign_key</tt> - name of the foreign key for the target side, 
        #   i.e. person_id_target. Defaults to the same value as +foreign_key+ with a <tt>_target</tt> suffix
        # * <tt>:conditions</tt> - optional, standard ActiveRecord SQL contition clause
